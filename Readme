This is a parser for the JSON[1] data format, written in C.
It's inspired by http://zserge.bitbucket.org/jsmn.html,
but with a more streamlined interface. In other words,
this parser doesn't do very much; it really only parses.
Doesn't do any converting or creating of higher-level data
structures for you.

To install, run

	make install

To use it, #include <json.h> in your C program.


Example (error handling omitted):

	JSON *value;
	int nvalue;

	nvalue = jsonparse(src, NULL, 0);     // 1. count values
	value = calloc(nvalue, sizeof(JSON)); // 2. allocate them
	jsonparse(src, value, nvalue);        // 3. parse them

If you know beforehand how many values to expect, you can
of course skip step 1 above.


Tips for traversing the output data:

 - The children of a JSON array form a linked list. The
   first child of a JSON array at value[n] is at value[n+1],
   and the second child is at value[n+1].next.

 - The keys and values of a JSON object form two linked
   lists. The first key and value in object at value[n] are
   at value[n+1] and value[n+2], and the second ones are at
   value[n+1].next and value[n+2].next.
